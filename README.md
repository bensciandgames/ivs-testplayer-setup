# ivs-testplayer-setup
this is a code that I am working on and will have bugs if anyone knows how to fix things and add more things let me know
so far I added the video player and offline screen with the defult play buttons I still have bugs in the code before I can move one to adding the viewer count 
from the aws ivs server that is a topic for another day 
 ok i fixed the a bug for now but for the viewer count its just says 100 or whatever number you want to put in there becouse its not actualy tied to the viewer count on ivs yet I got to tackel that later but I will update when I can
